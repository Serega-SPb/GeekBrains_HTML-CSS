                The domestic high quality figure maker Gecco has started a figure project of the hit action RPG series "DARK SOULS". <br>
                The latest release is a 1/6 scale polystone statue of "Siegmeyer of Catarina", extremely popular character with <br>
                a chubby armor and a helmet that looks like an onion! <br>
                He makes a few appearances as the story progresses and is usually worrying over something or falling asleep. <br>
                In the tough world of "Dark Souls"., many players surely found a moment of peace when looking at him. <br>
                This lovable character has been turned into a statue under the complete supervision of the FromSoftware design team. <br>
                Beside his characteristic armor, the impressive texture of the sculpture that lets you feels his long <br>
                fighting history and the paintwork are recreated with exceptional Gecco quality! Due to its shape it has <br>
                a massive volume that makes its look bigger than 1/6 scale. The decorations on the chest and back, <br>
                the chain mail sagging from the openings of the armor, the base that looks like a piece of the "Firelink Shrine" <br>
                and even the character's face slightly visible from the slit on his helmet have all been finely sculpted by Gecco, <br>
                creating a real masterpiece. <br>
                The sculpture was created by Shinya Akao (HEADLONG), who is also a big fan of "DARK SOULS". Looking at the statue <br>
                you can perceive his love for the character. The colored sample was painted by Katsuhige Akeyama (-accent-). <br>
